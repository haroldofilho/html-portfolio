<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Haroldo, a web developer based in Miami. I love turning ideas into digital experiences. My journey started with a fascination for how websites work,
  and now I focus on building clean, responsive, and accessible websites.
</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, you'll find me looking to discover new cities around the world.</p>

<p>I'm married to my life-long partner and father of my four-legged son Lolo, a beautiful white persian.</p>
