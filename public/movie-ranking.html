<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-Time</h2>

<h3>I'm Still here (2024)</h3> <img src="../assets/images/I'm Still Here Movie.png" />
<p>
  My favorite one, I'm Still Here <a href="https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3697657369/?ref_=ttvi_vi_imdb_3">(watch official trailler on IMDB here)</a> is a gut-wrenching tale of love and survival,
  as Fernanda Torres embodies a wife's unyielding fight for truth in the face of
  a dictatorship's terrifying silence. A must-see masterpiece of courage and
  heartbreak.

<h3>The Matrix (1999)</h3> <img src="../assets/images/TheMatrixMovie.png" />
<p>
  The Matrix <a href="https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1870579225/?ref_=ttvi_vi_imdb_1">(watch official trailler on IMDB here)</a> plunges you into a reality so warped and visionary, it feels like
  waking from a dream you never knew you were in. Pure cinematic innovation!
</p>
<h3>Joker (2019)</h3> <img src="../assets/images/JokerMoviePIC.png" />
<p>The movie Joker <a href="https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1723318041/?ref_=ttvi_vi_imdb_28">(watch official trailler on IMDB here)</a> is chilling descent into madness. Awesome performance by Joaquin Phoenix!</p>
